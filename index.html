    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Shayan Aamir, a Computer Science undergraduate at FAST-NUCES Karachi with a strong interest in AI-powered web
      applications, data science, and machine learning. I enjoy building end-to-end solutions that combine intelligent
      algorithms with clean, scalable web systems.
      I recently completed a Summer 2025 AI Web App Internship at Nexium, where I developed and deployed multiple
      full-stack AI applications. My work included an AI-based Blog Summarizer, an AI Recipe Generator with Supabase
      authentication and n8n workflows, and interactive web tools using Python, Django, Flask, MongoDB, Supabase, and
      React.Beyond internships, I have built projects such as a Grocery Store Management System with role-based access
      control and a Machine Learning–based Cricket Match Predictor using Random Forests and recommendation systems. I
      enjoy working with data-driven systems, recommender algorithms, and backend architectures.
      I am passionate about continuous learning, problem-solving, and building impactful software that blends AI, data,
      and real-world applications.

      <h3>Ashes Predictor</h3>
      <p>The Ashes 2025-2026 Win Predictor is a machine learning web application that forecasts outcomes of the Ashes
        cricket series between England and Australia. Built with Python and Flask, it uses a Random Forest model trained
        on 2000-2023 Ashes data to predict match winners, series outcomes, and win probabilities.The system includes
        AI-powered pitch analysis using DeepSeek API to assess venue conditions, and a dynamic team selection algorithm
        that generates venue-specific playing 11s based on pitch characteristics, player form, and performance metrics.
        It also features a hybrid recommendation system with seven algorithms (content-based, collaborative filtering,
        hybrid, venue-based, similarity-based, popularity-based) for player recommendations.The application integrates
        real-time cricket data from CricAPI and ESPN Cricinfo APIs to provide up-to-date squad information and player
        statistics. The interactive dashboard, built with Bootstrap 5, visualizes predictions, team selections,
        historical analysis, and recommendation comparisons, making complex data accessible and actionable for cricket
        enthusiasts and analysts.</p>

      <h3>https-client-server</h3>
      <p>This project simulates real-world computer networking concepts by demonstrating HTTP client-server
        communication, packet routing, congestion control, and performance analysis in an integrated environment. It
        visually represents different network topologies such as star, mesh, ring, and custom designs to help understand
        network structure and behavior. The system illustrates packet flow through routers using routing algorithms and
        hop-by-hop traversal to explain data transmission. It also analyzes key performance metrics including latency,
        throughput, and various delay components through graphical visualizations. Network congestion scenarios are
        modeled using queue-based simulations to show packet buffering and dropping behavior. Overall, the project
        bridges theoretical networking concepts with practical, hands-on simulation and visualization.</p>

      <h3>Home Prices</h3>
      <p>This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price
        prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices
        dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve
        http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home
        square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model
        building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and
        removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross
        validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,Python Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
        Matplotlib for data visualization Sklearn for model building Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as
        IDE Python flask for http server HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI</p>
