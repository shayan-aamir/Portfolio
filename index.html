    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Fuelled by curiosity and driven by purpose, I am a Computer Science undergraduate at FAST-NUCES Karachi with a passion for crafting technology solutions that make life easier, smarter, and more connected.From building a voice assistant powered by NLP and Python to designing a fully synchronized ice cream factory simulator using C and POSIX threads, I find joy in translating complex problems into elegant, scalable solutions. I‚Äôm especially interested in backend development, systems programming, and machine learning. I bring to the table hands-on experience in C++, Python, Django, and multithreaded programming, along with a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design.Outside the code editor, I‚Äôve been an active contributor to FAST‚Äôs tech ecosystem‚Äîwhether by helping orchestrate large-scale events like Procom'24 and the ACM Career Fair or by supporting fellow students through collaboration and initiative. I‚Äôve been recognized as a ‚ÄúStar Performer‚Äù for my contributions to both technical and organizational efforts.My ultimate goal is to blend my technical skills with real-world impact, working on software that addresses user needs while pushing boundaries in performance and reliability. I‚Äôm always open to connecting with fellow developers, mentors, and teams building meaningful tech.Let‚Äôs connect! Whether you‚Äôre a recruiter, peer, or collaborator‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to discuss opportunities, share ideas, or contribute to your next big project.

      <h3>Acting_CLone</h3>
      <p>‚≠ê Built a Real-Time Neon Pose Tracker and 3D Skeleton Visualizer. While exploring real-time AI and computer vision, I aimed to build a visually engaging human pose tracking system using only Python.Utilized OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Matplotlib to track body movements in real time, applied neon gradient effects, added motion trails, and rendered a dynamic 3D skeleton.Delivered an interactive system that accurately detects and animates poses with a live FPS counter and fallback ‚ÄúSCANNING‚Äù interface when no pose is detected.

      <h3>Home Prices</h3>
      <p>This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,Python Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning Matplotlib for data visualization Sklearn for model building Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE Python flask for http server HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI</p>
